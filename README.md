WebImageCreator
===============
The WIC makes it extremely straight-forward and easy to create high-quality / small-sized copies of your large image files. These images can then be uploaded to the web or your favorite social networking site, sent via e-mail, or even just used to minimize the space needed for storing your pictures. It was designed with speed and ease of use in mind, simplified to accommodate any level of computer user; with only a few mouse clicks you can create copies of all your picture files in an entire folder.

Built with C#.NET using an advanced implementation of GDI+ to create the highest quality image copy possible, while also maintaining the original image properties such as the aspect ratio, exif information, and resolution.

Includes user input fields for customizing the images you create while not overwhelming you with technical options that the average computer user would never use.

All error handling is done behind the scenes and recorded in a log file, no annoying popup boxes or validation messages.
