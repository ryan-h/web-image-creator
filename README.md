WebImageCreator
===============

Web Image Creator makes it straight-forward and easy to create high-quality / small-sized copies of your large image files. These new, smaller images can then be uploaded to the web or your favorite social networking site, sent via e-mail, displayed in a digital picture frame, etc.

Designed with speed and usability in mind, Web Image Creator is specially simplified to accommodate all users: With just a few clicks, you can create web images for your entire picture library!

Web Image Creator's multi-threaded, parallel programming allows for the fast processing of all your images, and uses the GDI+ framework to ensure the highest-quality copy possible. Each new web image also maintains the aspect ratio, exif information, and resolution of the original image.

Includes user input fields for customizing your images, but without overwhelming, technical options that the average computer user would never use.

All error handling is done behind the scenes and recorded in a log file: no annoying popups or validation messages.
