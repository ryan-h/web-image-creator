Browse for the folder containing the original image files, or you can enter the location manually.

Next change the Image Details and/or Folder Details that will be used for the new web images, or just use the defaults.

Each web image maintains the original aspect ratio using the "Max Height" and "Max Width", and is compressed based on the "JPG Quality Percentage" (100 = lowest compression/highest quality).

A new folder will be created for the web images, inside the original images folder, using the "New Folder Name".

The name for each web image will be the same as the original. If a "File Name Suffix" is provided, this will be added at the end of the original name.

If the images folder contains other folders that you want included in the process, then select the "Include Subfolders" checkbox.

Now click the "Create Images" button!
